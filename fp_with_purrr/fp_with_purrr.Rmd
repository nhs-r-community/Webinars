> **Functional programming** (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building
software by composing **pure functions**, avoiding shared state, mutable data,
and **side-effects**. Functional programming is **declarative** rather than
imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with
object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and 
colocated withmethods in objects.

> Functional programming is a **programming paradigm**, meaning that it is a way
of thinking about software construction based on some fundamental, defining 
principles (listed above). Other examples of programming paradigms include 
object oriented programming and procedural programming.

> Functional code tends to be more concise, more predictable, and easier to test
than imperative or object oriented code — but if you’re unfamiliar with it and
the common patterns associated with it, functional code can also seem a lot more
dense, and the related literature can be impenetrable to newcomers.

# functions

## creating functions

creating functions in R is pretty simple: we assign a function to a variable,
just like any other variable assignment:

```{r}
my_fn <- function(x) {
  2 * x
}
```

a function is made up of arguments (the bit between the parentheses) and the
body (the bit between the curly brackets). The last executed expression is
"returned" from the function

```{r}
my_fn(3)
```

---

arguments are like variables that we can specify when we "call" the function.

a function can have 0 arguments, or many arguments

```{r}
my_fn <- function() {
  3
}
my_fn()
```

```{r}
my_fn <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
my_fn(3, 2)
```

a function can be "variadic" by specifying a `...` argument, this is somewhat
outside of the scope for today, but allows you to create functions with a
variable number of arguments. Often in R this is used to provide arguments that
are passed to other functions.

```{r eval = FALSE}
function(x, y, ...) {
  other_function(...)
}
```

---

The body of the function can be split over multiple lines of code. It's common
to include flow-control statements within a function, e.g.

- `if` and `else` statements
- `for` and `while` loops
- `stop` statements (used to produce an "error" message)
- `return` statements (immediately exits the function returning a given value)

.pull-left[
```{r}
my_fn <- function(x) {
  if (x > 10) {
    stop ("x is too big!")
  } else if (x > 5) {
    return (x*2)
  }
  y <- x - 1
  for (i in 1:5) {
    y <- y*2
  }
  y
}
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, error = TRUE}
my_fn(2)
my_fn(5)
my_fn(6)
my_fn(11)
```
]

---

## function argument/variable scope

the values that are used in the function only exist in the function: we can't
use them outside of the function

```{r}
my_fn <- function(x) {
  y <- 2 * x
  c(exists("x"), exists("y"))
}

my_fn(3)
c(exists("x"), exists("y"))
```

---

we can access variables that are defined outside of the function, but we can't
modify them<sup>*</sup>

```{r}
v <- 8

my_fn <- function(x) {
  y <- 2 * x
  v <- v - 1
  y + v
}

my_fn(3)
```

Now, inside the function call we decreased the value of `v`, but if we look at
what value `v` has now we will see it hasn't changed

```{r}
v
```

R has created a new version of `v` inside the function and updated that value.

.small[
<sup>*</sup> we can modify then using the `<<-` operator, but this should be
avoided
]

---

## default arguments

you can specify default values for arguments: an argument with a default value
does not have to be specified when you call the function

```{r}
my_fn <- function(x, y = 3) {
  x + y
}

my_fn(4)
```

In this case we only passed a value for `x` (3), `y` defaulted to 3. But you can
provide values, like so

```{r}
my_fn(4, 5)
```

---

## argument order

by default, the arguments are evaluated in order (`x`, then `y`). But, you can
specify them in any order if you provide the name of the argument:

```{r}
my_fn(y = 5, x = 4)
my_fn(y = 5, 4)
```

---

## using functions like variables

because functions are just variables, you are able to pass functions as
arguments to other functions

```{r}
average <- function(values, fn) {
  fn(values)
}

average(c(1, 2, 5, 8), mean)
average(c(1, 2, 5, 8), median)
```

note, here the functions are passed without the parentheses: we are passing the
function, not the result of evaluating the function

---

you can inspect a function just by typing it's name

```{r}
my_fn
```

you can also inspect functions from other packages, but this may not always be
very useful<sup>*</sup>

```{r}
mean
```

.small[
<sup>*</sup> functions that look like "UseMethod" use S3 generics, which are outside of
the scope of this session. See Object Orientated chapters from
[Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/oo.html)
]

---

functions can be returned from other functions: this pattern is sometimes called
a "function factory", as the "outer" function can produce many different
functions.

```{r}
dice <- function(sides) {
  function(rolls) {
    sample(1:sides, rolls, TRUE)
  }
}

five_sided <- dice(5)

five_sided(1)
five_sided(10)

dice(12)(20)
```

---

## pure functions

A pure function is a function that given the same inputs always returns the same
outputs with no side-effects, that is we aren't changing any state in the
program.

.pull-left[
#### an impure function

```{r}
value <- 4
my_fn <- function(x) {
  x + value
}
a <- my_fn(3)
value <- 10
b <- my_fn(3)
c(a, b)
```
]
.pull-right[
#### a pure function

```{r}
value <- 4
my_fn <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
a <- my_fn(3, value)
value <- 10
b <- my_fn(3, value)
c(a, b)
```
]

Pure-functions are much easier to reason with; we can replace a function with
the results of the function and our program would still execute in the same way.
This makes it much easier to reason with and test your code.

However, it does eliminate a whole class of operations, like reading and writing
data from disk!

# vectors

---

There are two main types of vector in R:

.pull-left[
## Atomic vectors 

There are 4 main types of vector's that you will use:
* logical (`TRUE`/`FALSE`)
* integer
* double
* character

together, integer and double vectors are known as numerics.

Other types, such as dates and factors are built from these types of vectors,
but with attributes and classes to handle the additional logic and data required
to implement those types.

An atomic vector is homogenous: they only contain the one type of data.
]
.pull-right[
## Lists

A list is heterogenous: it can store different types of data, including other
lists.

```{r}
my_list <- list(1,
                c(2, 3),
                "Hello",
                list(4, 5))
str(my_list)
my_list[[2]]
```
]

---

## named vectors

.pull-left[
You can access items from a vector by position, for instance:

```{r}
letters[1:3]
```

Alternatively, you can create a named vector, and then you can access the items
by their name instead.

```{r}
named_vector <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
named_vector
named_vector[["a"]]
```
]

.pull-right[
You can also add names to a vector after it has been created. There are a couple
of ways of achieving this, but the best way is to use the `set_names` function
from `purrr`.

```{r}
1:3 %>% set_names(c("a", "b", "c"))
```

`set_names` will use a provided vector of values and set these as the names of
the items. If you don't provide a vector of names, it will use the values of the
vector to create the names instead.

```{r}
letters[1:3] %>% set_names()
```
]

---

## dataframes/tibbles

.pull-left[
A dataframe is just a named list, but with a specific constraint: each item in
the list is a vector, and every vector in the list has the same length.

That is, items in the list are the columns in the dataframe, and the rows are
the n<sup>th</sup> items from each vector.

The names of the items in the list are the column names.
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
class(iris)
typeof(iris)
length(iris)
str(iris)
```
]

---

# iteration

---


Imagine we have a series of numbers:

```{r}
my_values <- c(1,4,5,3,2)
my_values
```

and a function:

```{r}
my_fn <- function(x) {
  3 * x + 2
}
```

If we wanted to get the value of `my_fn(x)` for each value from `my_values`, we
could simply run:

```{r}
my_fn(my_values)
```

This is because R is a "vectorised" language. However, not all functions work
like this, so sometimes you have to fall back to writing a loop.

---

# for loops

.pull-left[
First we have to set up a "results" vector to store the values in:

```{r}
results <- numeric(length(my_values))
results
```

Then we need to set up a loop to iterate over the values:

```{r}
for (i in 1:length(my_values)) {
  results[[i]] <- my_fn(my_values[[i]])
}
results
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Writing out a loop like this though is problematic.

- We can forget to initialise our results vector...
- ...or we could initialise it incorrectly (too big or too small)
- We could set up the loop incorrectly (not iterate over all the items from
  `my_values`, or go past the end of it)
- We could mess up the indexing into results and my_values, e.g. we could always
  use the first value from `my_values` if we write `my_fn(my_values[[1]])`
]

???

purists would argue the loop should be `for(i in seq_along(my_values))` to
prevent issues of not iterating over the list correctly

---

# map

the function `map` can replace for loops: it takes as arguments the input that
you wish to iterate over, and a function that you want to evaluate each item
from the input against.

.pull-left[
![](map.png)
(image from [Advanced-R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functionals.html),
CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0)
]
.pull-right[

```{r}
results <- map(my_values, my_fn)
results
```

]

---

This gives us the correct results, but `map` always returns a `list`. Lists are
much harder to work with, for example, we can't write something like this now:

```{r error = TRUE}
mean(results)
```

--

But `purrr` provides variants of the `map` function if your function returns a single
value. There are 4 main variants that are for when you return an atomic vector:

- `map_lgl` for logicals
- `map_int` for integers
- `map_dbl` for doubles
- `map_chr` for characters

In the previous example, our function returns a double, so we can use `map_dbl`

```{r}
map_dbl(my_values, my_fn)
```

---

## the function argument

if the function you are using is only ever going to be used in that map
expression, you can create an "anonymous" function:

```{r}
map_dbl(my_values, function(x) {
  3 * x + 2
})
```

purrr also provides a "formula" syntax which is much quicker to type out

```{r}
map_dbl(my_values, ~ 3 * .x + 2)
```

--
but which is the best to use?
--

- formula syntax is great if your function is a simple, one-liner
- anonymous syntax works well if your function is a little more complex
- if you have a very complex function that runs over multiple lines, or the
  function is used by more than just one map statement, then create a function
  in the environment

---

if your function has more arguments that you need to set, then these can be
passed in via the "..." argument of `map`

.pull-left[
![](map-arg-recycle.png)
(image from [Advanced-R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functionals.html),
CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0)
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
my_fn <- function(x, y) {
  3 * x + y
}

map_dbl(my_values, my_fn, 2)
```

it's good practice to use the name of the argument though

```{r}
map_dbl(my_values, my_fn, y = 2)
```
]

---

# Using map with dataframes

if we use `map` with a dataframe as the input, it will run the function against
each column, using all of the values in the columns.

For example, if you have a dataframe with 5 columns and 150 rows, running `map`
will run the function 5 times (not 150 times, or 5 * 150 times).

*remember: a dataframe can be thought of as a list*

this can be useful to do things like:

---

#### look at the classes of each column in your dataframe

```{r}
head(iris, 3)
```

```{r}
map_chr(iris, class)
```

compare that to

```{r}
class(iris)
```

---

#### calculate some summary for each column

e.g. number of unique values in each column

```{r}
head(iris, 3)
```

```{r}
iris %>%
  map(unique) %>%
  map_dbl(length)
```

We can also see here that we can achieve more complex results by chaining map
statements together

---

Note that there are many, possibly better, ways to achieve results in R.

With the previous example, we could just stick to dplyr and write

```{r}
iris %>% summarise_all(n_distinct)
```

map is a very generalised way to solve a problem though; it can help solve
problems that may have clever solutions, but solutions that require you to know
other tricks and/or functions.

---

# Using map within dataframes

You can use `map` within a mutate statement to create a new column of values.
This can be useful if you want to create a column of values from another column,
but the function is not vectorised: e.g. you cannot just run a statement like
`mutate(new = fn(col))`

```{r}
tibble(files = dir(pattern = "\\.png$")) %>%
  mutate(filesize = map_dbl(files, file.size))
```

---

# A more practical example of using map

now, in the examples above we didn't need to resort to using `map` as the
functions were vectorised. But not all functions are, for example, what if we
want to read in a folder full of csvs?

```{r}
files <- dir("ae_attendances/",
             "^\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}\\.csv$",
             full.names = TRUE)
head(files, 10)
```

if we want to read in the files, what happens when we call `read_csv` with this
vector of file names?

---

```{r}
read_csv(files)
```

---

we could use map to iterate over the files and call the `read_csv`
function.

.small[it's good practice with `read_csv` to specify the column types, so I'm
adding this in: you will have to specify this yourself based on your file types]

```{r}
map(files, read_csv, col_types = "ccddd")
```

---

the output of this isn't the best though: `map` returns a list of dataframes,
in this case because all of the files are the same structure we might want to
load this into a single dataframe.

the `map_dfr` function returns a dataframe by binding rows (e.g. SQL UNION ALL).

```{r}
map_dfr(files, read_csv, col_types = "ccddd")
```

---

unfortunately, our csv's don't contain the date that the file relates to! if we
look again at the filenames, the date is in the filename

```{r}
head(files, 2)
```

`map_dfr` has a neat trick up it's sleeves though if you are using a named
vector: the `.id` argument takes the name of each item in the vector and adds it
to a column with the name that you give it. So first, we need a named vector:

```{r}
files %>%
  set_names() %>%
  head(3)
```

---

```{r}
files %>%
  set_names() %>%
  map_dfr(read_csv, col_types = "ccddd", .id = "filename") %>%
  # here I'm using a regular expression to find a string that looks like a date
  # in y-m-d format, which is followed by .csv, and the .csv is the end of the
  # string
  mutate(period = str_extract(filename,
                              r"(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}(?=\.csv$))") %>%
           lubridate::ymd())
```

.small[

# more variants on map

.pull-left[
`map` works over a single vector of values, but what if you have a binary
function (a function that takes two arguments)?

`map2` takes two vectors as argument, `.x` and `.y`, and a binary function `.f`.

`map2` also has the same variants as `map`, for example `map2_dbl`:

```{r}
map2_dbl(1:3, 4:6, ~ .x * .y)
```
]
.pull-right[
`pmap` is a generalisation of map that works over as many vectors as you have.

You have to put all of your vectors into a list, and then have a function that
accepts as many arguments as you have vectors. The vectors are passed into the
function in the order you specify them...

```{r}
list(1:3, 4:6, 7:9) %>%
  pmap_dbl(function(x, y, z) x * y + z)
```

... unless you use a named vector, then purrr will match the list items to the
functions arguments

```{r}
list(a = 1:3, b = 4:6, c = 7:9) %>%
  pmap_dbl(function(c, b, a) a * b + c)
```

]

---

# walk

`walk` is like `map`, except it is designed for functions that you want to run
solely for the side-effect.

`walk` doesn't have equivalents to `map_*`, but there is `walk2` and `pwalk`.

Instead of returning the results of the initial function, `walk` returns the
input vector, e.g. while

```
map(.x, .f) => .f(.x)
```

with walk we have

```
walk(.x, .f) => .x
```

`walk` is useful to use with operations like saving plots to disk.

# demo

---

## In base R:

the `apply`/`lapply` functions from base R does the same thing as `map`. There
are then `sapply`/`vapply` which are most similar to the `map_*` functions, but
they are not as easy (in my opinion) to work with.

The `map` functions have a far more consistent api to work with, and the
documentation is much more approachable and easier to understand.

---

# `map` summary:

- map is like a for loop where you apply a function to every item in the input
- the first argument of map is the input (you want to map over)
- the second argument is the function (you want to apply)
- the ... argument's are passed to the function (for every input)
- map returns a list, map_* returns a vector of that type
- map_dfr returns a dataframe binding by rows (map_dfc binds by columns)
- the function argument can either be a defined function (from a package, or
  one you have created), an anonymous function, or a formula
- map2 is for when you have 2 vectors to iterate over (as a pair)
- pmap is for when you have multiple vectors to iterate over (all the vectors
  are contained in a list)
- walk/walk2/pwalk is for when you want to execute a function just for the side
  effects
